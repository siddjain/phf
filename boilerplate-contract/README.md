This folder contains a boilerplate smart contract together with tests. It can be used
as a template to write your own smart contract in Typescript. This boilerplate smart
contract is identical to a new smart contract generated using IBM Blockchain 
Extension for VS Code; the only difference being that the test is moved into a 
separate folder from the source code.
